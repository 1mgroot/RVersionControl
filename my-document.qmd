# Introduction

This document will demonstrate reproducible code execution. When you render this Quarto document, Quarto will:

-   Create a Python virtual environment.
-   Install all packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
-   Execute all code chunks in that environment.

You donâ€™t need to do anything else. Just open `my-document.qmd` in RStudio and click "Render." Everyone who gets this project with the `_quarto.yml` and `requirements.txt` will have the same environment.

## Python Code Example

```{python}

```
